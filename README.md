Density Analysis Tool for 3D spatial statistics

The main procedure:

  Span density spheres on each point for given sets
  Summarize them in a global tensor
  Measure the area/volume of each set by tresholding the densities
  Measure the area/volume of intersections

Features:

  +batch processing available for multiple inputs
  +plot the density for each set
  -plot the intersections of different sets
